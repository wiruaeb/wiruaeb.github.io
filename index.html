    <h2>Economic importance of fish in Lake Michigan</h2>
    <p>Fishing in West Michigan is a huge part of the culture. Not only does it feed people, but it is also a huge industry that helps the economy during the summer months.</p>
    <p>Charter fishermen open for business, as well as many of the seasonal restaurants. Fish are able to supply money to these communities to help keep them afloat.</p>

    <h1>Environmental impacts of fishing in Lake Michigan</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fish populations</li>
        <li>Invasive species</li>
        <li>Food web interactions</li>

    <h2>Lake Michigan Salmon/Trout lifecycle</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>- Spawn within inland stream/river</h3>
        <h3>- Feed while in the river, grow to adolescence</h3>
        <h3>- Travel downstream to the lake</h3>
        <h3>- Feed on Alewife/other bait fish until matured for about 2-4 years</h3>
        <h3>- Return to the same stream they were spawned in, spawn their own eggs, and then die</h3>
