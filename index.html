    <h2>Importance of fish in Lake Michigan</h2>
    <p>Fishing in West Michigan is a huge part of the culture. Not only does it feed people, but it is also a huge industry that helps the economy during the summer months.
    <p>Charter fisherman open for business, as well as many of the seasonal restaurants. Fish are able to supply money to these communities to help keep them afloat.</p>
